content a
==========
content b==========
content c==========
```

Running the script will output:

```
content a
content b
content c
```

This script makes extracting the content straightforward and ensures only the relevant portions are captured.

question: can I use grep to filter the every part


Yes, you can use a combination of `grep` and other command-line utilities like `awk` or `sed` to extract parts between the delimiter `==========`. Below is an example of how you can achieve this using a Bash script. 

### Using `awk`:

Here's a Bash script using `awk` that will extract and print parts between the delimiter `==========`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# File name passed as an argument to the script
file="$1"

# Check if file exists
if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
  echo "File not found!"
  exit 1
fi

# Using awk to extract the content between delimiters
awk 'BEGIN { RS = "=========="; FS="\n" }
     NR > 1 { print $0 }
    ' "$file" | sed '/^\s*$/d'
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `extract_parts.sh`, and make it executable with:

```bash
chmod +x extract_parts.sh
```

Then you can run it with:

```bash
./extract_parts.sh yourfile.txt
```

### Using `grep` and `awk`:

If you want to stick with `grep`, you can use a combination of `grep` and `awk`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file="$1"

# Check if file exists
if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
  echo "File not found!"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract content between delimiters
grep -vE '^\s*==========' "$file"
```

Save the above code in a file, say `extract_grep.sh`, make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x extract_grep.sh
```

And run it with:

```bash
./extract_grep.sh yourfile.txt
```

### Explanation:

- The `awk` script sets the record separator `RS` to `==========`, which means each section between `==========` is treated as a record.
- `NR` is the number of records. We skip the first record (which is empty in this case since it starts with `==========`), and print the rest.
- `sed '/^\s*$/d'` is used to remove empty lines that might be introduced.

In the `grep` approach:
- `grep -vE '^\s*=========='` filters out lines consisting only of `==========` with possible leading/trailing whitespaces.
